# FEMAdviceGenerator

 I used this project from Front End Mentor to practice making apps that a client might give me in the real world.
 It ended up being such a great opportunity to practice my UI skills, making the app responsive, & making native api calls in swift.
 There were a few things that didn't work out the way I wished. One, it isn't 100% responsive, some views were just a little 
 off on some iPhone sizes.
 Also, I had to create a random number for the AdviceNumHeaderView(), because I wasn't able to call the ID from the api, 
 but the advice quotes worked fine. The last thing I was hoping to do was add quotes around each piece of advice, 
 but escaping & concatenating did not work.
 
If you happen to come across this project and want to give me feedback, it is welcome.
